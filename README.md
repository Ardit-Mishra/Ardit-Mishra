# 👋 Hi, I'm Ardit Mishra

Bioinformatics graduate (Loyola University Chicago, 2024)  
AI/ML developer focused on computational biology and applied data science  
Futures trader with 5+ years of experience trading NQ, ES, and Gold through proprietary firms  

I build modular, reproducible systems at the intersection of bioinformatics, machine learning, and quantitative modeling. My focus is on designing technically rigorous tools that are well-documented, transparent, and grounded in real-world applications.

## 📈 Quantitative & Financial Systems

I have over five years of experience trading futures markets (NQ, ES, Gold) through proprietary trading firms.

I am currently developing quantitative research and automation systems focused on:

- Risk modeling  
- Strategy evaluation  
- Reinforcement learning-based signal research  
- Trading dashboards and analytics tools  

Finance-focused repositories will be added once they meet the same documentation and reproducibility standards as my bioinformatics projects.

## 🌱 Always Learning & Building

I approach every project as a long-term system, not a one-off experiment.

I continuously:

- Explore advanced ML architectures (CNNs, LSTMs, Transformers, ensemble models)  
- Improve reproducibility and documentation standards  
- Integrate backend APIs with interactive frontends  
- Expand into scalable, production-ready system design  
- Study financial modeling and quantitative systems  

My GitHub reflects an evolving research-oriented portfolio built through disciplined iteration.
