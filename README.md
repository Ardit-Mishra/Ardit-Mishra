## 🚀 Featured Projects (in-progress & growing)  

🔬 **Bioinformatics**  
- [Genome Sequencing Analyzer](https://github.com/Ardit-Mishra/genome-sequencing-analyzer) – A web app to upload DNA sequences and instantly analyze GC content, k-mers, and reading frames. Built with React + FastAPI + Biopython (with optional C++ optimization).  
- [Peptide–MHC Binding Predictor](https://github.com/Ardit-Mishra/peptide-mhc-binding-predictor) – Predicts immune system binding of peptides using deep learning models (CNNs, BiLSTMs, Transformers) with an Angular dashboard for results.  
- [Gene Set Enrichment Web App](https://github.com/Ardit-Mishra/gene-set-enrichment-app) – Upload a gene list and get GO/KEGG enrichment results with interactive plots. Built with React + Python APIs (g:Profiler).  
- [Drug Response Predictor](https://github.com/Ardit-Mishra/drug-response-predictor) – Machine learning models that predict whether a compound might be effective against a disease, with explainable outputs using SHAP.  

📈 **Finance / Data Science**  
- [Futures Trading Bot](https://github.com/Ardit-Mishra/futures-trading-bot) – Automated futures trading bot that uses reinforcement learning and LSTMs for signals, with a React dashboard to visualize trades.  
- [Market Sentiment Analyzer](https://github.com/Ardit-Mishra/market-sentiment-analyzer) – Analyzes financial news & social media using NLP Transformers (FinBERT) to measure market sentiment in real time.  
- [Portfolio Risk Dashboard](https://github.com/Ardit-Mishra/portfolio-risk-dashboard) – A risk and forecasting dashboard for portfolios using Monte Carlo simulations and Bayesian VAR forecasting, deployed with Angular + FastAPI.  
- [Fraud Detection App](https://github.com/Ardit-Mishra/fraud-detection-app) – Upload financial transactions to detect anomalies using Isolation Forests and Autoencoders, with an interactive React interface.

## 🌱 Always Learning & Building  
These are just some of my current projects.  
I am constantly:  
- Building new **bioinformatics & AI tools** that solve real problems.  
- Expanding into **finance, cloud, and advanced ML/AI architectures**.  
- Exploring new stacks (Docker, full-stack frameworks, scalable APIs).  
- Documenting my work so anyone can **learn from and replicate** my projects.  

My GitHub will continue to grow with **new projects, experiments, and skills** as I strive to become a stronger developer, researcher, and problem-solver.
